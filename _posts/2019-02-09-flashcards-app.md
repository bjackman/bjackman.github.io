title:  "Finding a flashcard app to learn vocabulary"
---

I wanted an app to learn Vietnamese vocab. My requirements are:

- Easy to import and export cards, so you're not locked in
- Sensible interface for creating new cards
- A smart system for deciding which cards need studying when

Of course you want a mobile app, so you can study in any spare moment, and so
you can note down new vocab you encounter - straight into the memory hopper.
Also in my case, Vietnamese has loads of diacritical marks which seem easier to
deal with on a mobile keyboard.

Naturally, a problem as simple as this has been solved badly many times by many
different people, so I went through quite a few duds before eventually finding a
free option I was satisfied with. That's why I'm writing this down so others can
see farther by standing on my beautiful giant
[shoulders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants). The
one I eventually found was [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - [Not to be
confused](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/71bhyy/ankiapp_is_not_part_of_the_anki_ecosystem/)
with the misleadingly-named AnkiApp. The UX isn't _amazingly_ slick, but hey, if
you don't have the energy to figure it out then you won't have the energy to
study vocab either. It's also free and open-source which is just right for this
kind of simple application.

The training goes like this: you see one side of a card, try to remember what's
on other side, flip it over and see if you got it right, then press one of:
"again" (I didn't know ir, show me again soon), "good" (I got it, but show me
again soonish) or "easy" (I definitely know this one). This is exactly how I
used to learn vocab with physical flashcards; a pile for the words I didn't know
at all, a pile for the cards I knew but needed cementing, and a pile for the
cards I hardly needed to study any more. Afterwards you can view stats and
track how much learning you're doing.

Nice.
