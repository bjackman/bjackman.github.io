# My blong

TODOs after `hugo import`ing from old Jekyll version:

- [x] Figure out why I can't see any pages
- [ ] Add a list to the homepage
- [ ] Bring back my fancy old 404 page
- [ ] Look through deleted files and figure out if anything important was lost:

      ```
        deleted:    404.html
        deleted:    Gemfile
        deleted:    Gemfile.lock
        deleted:    README.md
        deleted:    _assets/js/pangrams.html
        deleted:    _config.yml
        deleted:    _posts/table.html
        deleted:    about.md
        deleted:    creeps_tutorial.html
      ```
- [ ] Check all  pages still work
- [ ] Figure this shit out:
