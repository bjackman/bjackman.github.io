Do you remember how to run Ruby projects? No you do not.

- Clone 'er up
- `apt install rubygems`
- `gem install bundler`
- `bundle install`
- `bundle exec jekyll serve`

If you get an error like "can't find gem bundler (>= 0.a) with executable bundle
(Gem::GemNotFoundException)", congratulations you have met the Dependency
Management Solution Badger.

Comment "thank you, Dependency Management Badger"
and share this repository with 5 friends within the next 16 lunar months or
experience bad package managers for 1 Martian year. You can fix this by
installing the version of bundler that matches the "BUNDLED WITH" bit of the
`Gemfile.lock`.
