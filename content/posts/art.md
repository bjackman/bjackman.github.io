Some people seem to think the value of art is threatened by the ability of AI to
make it. These people don't understand the point of art.

When I enjoy watching a film, it's partly because of the pretty colours and
sometimes you get to see a lady's nipples. AI can do this bit.

There are no colours or nipples at all in Dr Strangelove. If I'm totally honest
that film looks like shit (why didn't Kubrick shoot it in Technicolor? [Was he
stupid?](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/is-he-stupid-is-she-smart-are-they-stupid)).
But Dr Strangelove makes me lol. AI can't do this bit yet, but I think it will be
able to sooner or later.

I will still cherish Dr Strangelove because, while making me lol, it teaches me
something about how people saw and understood the world 60 years ago, and what
they found funny about it. Not "teaches" in the sense that we can discuss it in a
seminar and write essays about it, but in the sense that having a conversation
with someone teaches you something about their personality. In the sense that
having sex with someone teaches you something about their feelings towards you.

AI can't do that bit. Not because it lacks capabilities but because there is no
human on the other end to learn about. I think soon AI will be able to generate
films that represent 1960s culture in a way that "teaches" me about it in some
sense, but not in the sense that I'm looking for when I sit down to watch a
film.

This doesn't have to be about 60-year-old cultural touchstones to be true. Teen
comedies and mediocre horror films might be more superficial, but they are still
fundamentally _connections between human beings_ reflecting on their experience
of being in the world together. When you watch Anchorman you are connecting with
Will Ferrell, and you are also forming a connection with _all the other people
who have watched Anchorman_. It will be neat if AI learns to make personalised
slop that's laser-targeted to make my specific brain lol and lmao, but I'll
still mostly want to watch the films my friends recommend.

This feels pretty obvious when I'm talking about films, but it's probably even
_more_ true for music. A big part of why I listen to music is that it makes my
brain do weird stuff that feels good. AI can do that bit. But when I come to
_love_ music, that's usually driven by the thrill of hearing someone use musical
vocabulary that I understand, in a way that's new and exciting to me. That
thrill comes from the feeling of connection to the musicians who built that
vocabulary and the musicians exploring it in a new way. AI can do that
exploration, but the thrill isn't there.

The first time you heard AI-generated music, wasn't it amazing? And then the
second time, you didn't give a fuck. I think it's common to see this as "supply
shock". It doesn't feel special when it's free to produce. But that economic
lens is the wrong one. The reason AI-generated music feels worthless is that
there's no human on the other end of that music, it's just an empty pipe.
