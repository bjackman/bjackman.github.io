title: 'Learning an alphabet is easy'
draft: true
---

I studied Russian at school. People often say, "Wow, Russian, that must be so
hard, with the different alphabet and all." I think this reveals that they're
thinking wrongly about learning a language. I think this wrongness is
instructive.

Learning a language is a really, really big deal. But you can memorise the
Cyrillic alphabet in an hour's work. You could probably master it in 10. It's
much harder than using chopsticks but it's much, _much_ easier than speaking
Russian[^1]. 

If you're jumping on the alphabet as a reason to be intimidated by Russian, then
you might not have internalised the much more intimidating fact that Russian is
a foreign language.

I also sometimes hear people say "I really want to learn German, and I think I'd
benefit from classes, but even the cheapest ones cost thousands per year". I
think this is a symptom of the same underestimation. If you want to learn German
enough that you're willing to do what it takes to learn German, but you hesitate
to spend a few grand on it, something is miscalibrated (unless you're
particularly cash-poor or time-rich).

Concrete mixers are expensive. If you're paving a short garden path, you can
save a bit of money by mixing the concrete with a shovel in a wheelbarrow. But
if you were building a concrete house you wouldn't consider this. Language
lessons are like concrete mixers[^2].

If you're building a house and someone says "wow, a house? But you'll have to
clear that topsoil before you can dig the foundations!" you'll give them a funny
look. Alphabets are like topsoil.

Houses and languages aren't the only projects out there. The daunting nature of
these huge tasks might be discouraging, but I think it can be liberating too.
When I walk long distances, I sometimes find a strange comfort in the first
twinges of pain in my feet. "This kinda hurts, but I set out to walk all day.
I know it's gonna hurt way more later, and I'm pretty sure I'll be able to
tolerate that, so I can easily tolerate this."

What am I saying here? Are things harder than you think, or easier? Yes,
whatever's more helpful. You can manipulate your perspective to break things
down. Dreading the topsoil? Well, zoom out; it's just one step of a whole house,
and didn't you say you were really excited about building that house? The
topsoil is nothing by comparison. Daunted by the house project? Zoom in; it's
just a long series of topsoil-scale problems that you know you can solve.

1,012 hours of _class time_ is needed to reach "professional working
proficiency".

[^2] I'm glossing over the fact that different people learn best in different
ways. For some people, language lessons might not help very much. But those
people are in a minority. And if you really want to learn a language, it's
probably worth spending a few grand _just to find out if you're one of those
people_.
